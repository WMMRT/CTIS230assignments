		<h2>Competitive Forces Analysis</h2>
			<p>The competition among rival sellers in this industry would be a fierce competitive pressure, particularly due toto technological advances allowing for a variety of different competitors. Home Depot addressed this in their 10-k, saying “Our industry is highly competitive and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online.” (Home Depot 10-K, 2019) The strategy that I would take directly aligns with what they feel that they should do. It would be an offensive oriented strategy, where the competitively price products lower to secure more market share, along with adapting their business model to the changing technologies, primarily delivery processes and online shopping.</p>
			<p>The threat of new entries into this market is perhaps the fiercest competitive pressure present in this industry, and this is due to the rise of internet shopping amongst consumers. This allows new companies to enter the industry without setting up brick and mortar stores across the country, and is a risk described by Home Depot in their most recent 10-K as mentioned in the competition amongst rival seller’s paragraph above. In this case, I recommend that Home Depot take a more offensive strategic approach, and focus on expanding their online retailing presence as a way to establish their place in the industry, and taking the market share that these new entrants would try to compete with.</p>
			<p>The threat of substitute products coming around is a weak competitive force, as with Home Depot being a retailer store, they would not be affected by substitute products, and would most likely sell those products too. To fight this, I would suggest a more defensive strategy, such as blocking avenues open to challengers. The big thing that they would do under this strategy would be to participate in the alternative technologies, or better yet adopt and sell these substitute goods. </p>
			<p>The threat of suppliers and their bargaining power seems to be a weak threat, since Lowes uses a variety of suppliers around the globe. Home Depot’s biggest threat in this department arises from potential disruption to their suppliers that would delay receiving inventories, however, they face little issues regarding supplier bargaining power. The strategic approach that I would recommend for Home Depot to tackle this would be to consider using their foothold over the market share in their industry to get suppliers to bargain with terms favorable to Home Depot. Maintaining their market share would be the biggest strategy to combat this issue.</p>
			<p>The force that is buyer bargaining power seems to be a moderate force in the home depot’s industry, as they are a retailer. Uncertainty in other major industries could cause demand to be driven down, leading to more bargaining power in the industry with the buyers. However, Buyers being consumers means that there won’t be a big united attack so to say, which could give them more bargaining power. The strategy that I would suggest addressing this would be to offer products that are equal or better than other companies at a lower price, to attract buyers and consumers when demand is driven down for the energy. </p>
			<p>Overall, I think that the most powerful forces that affect Home Depot industry is the forces from competitors and threats of new entrants, as they are fierce due to rapidly advancing technology changing how retail industries operate and allow for easier entry by new companies. The threat of buyers having bargaining power can be strong in some respects, as other industries failure could drive demand down, but without unity, bargaining power is going to be great. The threat of suppliers and substitute products are both weak threats, due to the variety of suppliers and product sold being high. I would recommend offensive strategies such as competitive pricing and embracing new technologies to combat the 2 greatest threats. We recommended more defensive strategies such as maintaining market share and adopting alternative strategies to address supplier power and the threat of substitute products.</p>
