		<h3><u>About The Paper</u></h3>
			<p>
				This paper was originally created in my business strategy class. It looked at the five forces model that had been developed by Porter, and applied it to the home improvement industry, from the perspective of Home Depot. It was a assignment that would eventually be used in my final strategic analysis paper that examined the industry

			<p>
				I wrote this paper in Febuary of 2020, and the Final paper referenced above would be written in March. I ended up having to write it without as much guidance on the assignment after the covid-19 oubreak.
